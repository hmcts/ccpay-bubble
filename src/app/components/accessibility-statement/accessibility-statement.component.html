        This website is run by HM Courts and Tribunals Service. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:</p>

        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.<br>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Compliance status</h2>

        <p>This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances, listed below.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-accessible content</h2>

        <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h2>

        <p>
        The page has no h1 headings. This failed to meet 2.4.6 Headings and Labels Level AA.<br/>
        The keyboard focus is not taken to the error summary and is not announced to screen reader users immediately. This failed to meet 3.3.1 Error Identification Level A.<br/>
        A form label is not accurate in its description so it would not make sense for screen reader users. Also, the words which visually label a component are not the words read by the screenreader. This failed to meet 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions Level A.<br/>
        The status message for how many results were found is not announced to screen reader users. This failed to meet 4.1.3 Status Messages Level AA.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What we're doing to improve accessibility</h2>
