        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Technical information about this website's accessibility</h2>

        <p>HMCTS is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Compliance status</h2>

        <p>This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances, listed below.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-accessible content</h2>

        <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h2>

        <p>A layout table is present but does not contain any header cells. The screen reader users are not able to associate the table data to table headings. This failed to meet 1.1.1 Non-Text Content Level A.<br/>
        The headings are not hierarchical and heading level 2 is skipped. There are multiple links that are identified as text elements rather than links (This issue pertains only to Safari browser not Google Chrome). A group of radio buttons are not enclosed in a fieldset. This failed to meet 1.3.1 Info and Relationships Level A.
        Some of the content gets lost or overlaps when the page is zoomed in to 200% on laptops and at actual size on a mobile device. This failed to meet 1.4.4 Resize Text Level AA.<br/>
        Some content can be lost or overlaps on different smaller devices. This fails to meet 1.4.10 Reflow.<br/>
        The highlight colour does not meet contrast requirements for links. The skip to main content link overlaps other content and then fails contrast. This failed to meet 1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast Level AA.<br/>
        There are multiple links that cannot be tabbed to from the keyboard or do not receive keyboard focus. This failed to meet 2.1.1 Keyboard Level A.<br/>
        The 'skip to main' content link does not skip to main content because the main content region is missing. The navigation landmark is also not present. This failed to meet 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks Level A.<br/>
        The page titles are not unique and do not describe the page. This failed to meet 2.4.2 Page Titled Level A.<br/>
        The pages look identical when searching for a case transaction, payment history, or service request. This could be confusing for users who might think they have not moved pages. The page has no h1 headings. This failed to meet 2.4.6 Headings and Labels Level AA.<br/>
        The language of the document is not identified or the lang attribute value is invalid. This failed to meet 3.1.1 Language of Page Level A.<br/>
        The keyboard focus is not taken to the error summary and is not announced to screen reader users immediately. This failed to meet 3.3.1 Error Identification Level A.<br/>
        A form label is not accurate in its description so it would not make sense for screen reader users. Also, the words which visually label a component are not the words read by the screenreader. This failed to meet 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions Level A.<br/>
        The status message for how many results were found is not announced to screen reader users. This failed to meet 4.1.3 Status Messages Level AA.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What we're doing to improve accessibility</h2>

To demonstrate this, we are going to engage with Digital Accessibility Centre to have a further review on 06/24<br/>
